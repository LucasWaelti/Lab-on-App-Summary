# Lab-on-App-Summary
This repository aims at summarizing the contents of the lab and the course

## How to contribute
- `AndroidSummary`: summary of the **lab**
- `???`: summary of the course -> create it!
To bring new contributions, ideas or enhancements, please create a new branch each time you want to modify something and create a pull request. Ask for a review from the other collaborators before merging to the main branch.

It would be good to add the pdf along with the LaTeX code that generated it to make things more readable. 

## How to upload file
Just drag and drop the source code and the pdf corresponding to it in the correct folder (`AndroidSummary`).
