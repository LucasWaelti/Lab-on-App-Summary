## How to contribute
To bring new contributions, ideas or enhancements, please create a new branch each time you want to modify something and create a pull request. Ask for a review from the other collaborators before merging to the main branch.

It would be good to add the pdf along with the LaTeX code that generated it to make things more readable.
